# ARC-Rod-Life-Tracker
This repository showcases an evaluation, or a deep dive, into a specific Key Performance Indicator to enhance coporate production and profits.

### Objective
1) Demonstrate, with emperical evidence, the highest performing historical rod string designs for rod pumping artifical lift systems on oil and gas wells
2) Propose rod string designs based on this data and evidence
3) Structure the analysis with Python around excel; a widely used platform in industy. This allows a comfortability around usage of the program. This was accomplished with Pandas.
